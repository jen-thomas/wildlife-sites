# wildlife-sites

This repository contains a Django application which is designed to hold a set of sites that are good for wildlife watching.

## Motivation
We are keen wildlife watchers, in particular of birds and insects. Whilst discovering new areas recently with the help of wildlife guides and online recommendations, we discovered that it was extremely difficult to plan a visit to a certain area and look up if there were any recommended sites nearby and what to see there. 

## Aspects of database

### Sites
Sites can be named and located using a map, latitude and longitude and country. 

### Species
Species can be listed in terms of latin name, class and order (in order to be able to search more readily). They can also be listed in different languages (English, Catalan and Spanish are set-up here).

### Time of year
Sites can be good spots for seeing different species at different times of year. 

### Source
The source of the information about the site can be listed in terms of type, title, author and URI.
